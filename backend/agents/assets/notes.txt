added some more notes... yay!

These are my notes in general....Saturday, May 03, 2025

Dear Journal,

Okay, so today was… different. I guess I felt… powerful? In control? It's hard to put my finger on it, but there was this sense of just… being unbothered by everything. Like all the usual anxieties and pressures just slid right off. I didn't really *try* to be anything, I just… was. And somehow, that felt really good. I don't know if it's something I can replicate, or even *should* replicate, but it was definitely a departure from the usual overthinking and second-guessing. I wonder if this is what people mean when they talk about inner peace? Maybe not, but it was definitely a step in a direction I wouldn't mind exploring further. Now I just need to figure out what triggered it, and if it's something sustainable.

Until next time,

Dear Journal,

It feels like I'm pushing against a current. Not a raging torrent, just a persistent, unwavering pull that never lets up. I'm putting in the work, I really am. I'm showing up, trying to learn, trying to be better. But there's this deep-seated weariness that clings to me like a second skin. A weariness that whispers, "Is it even worth it?" even as I'm reaching for the next rung. Maybe it's the weight of expectation, or the fear of failure, or just the sheer, unrelenting effort of it all. Whatever it is, it's heavy. And sometimes, just sometimes, I wonder if my best is even good enough. I keep telling myself to keep going, that breakthroughs happen after the struggle. But right now, all I feel is the struggle.

Until next time,

Dear Journal,

It feels like I'm constantly pushing uphill, a Sisyphean task with no end in sight. I tell myself I'm doing my best, and I genuinely believe it – most of the time. But then doubt creeps in, that insidious little voice whispering that maybe my "best" isn't good enough. Maybe I'm just spinning my wheels, expending all this energy for nothing. It's just... hard. A bone-deep weariness that settles into my soul. Some days I can almost ignore it, bury it under layers of productivity or distraction. But then there are days like today, when it rises to the surface and threatens to drown me. I just wish it wasn't so damn hard. I wish I could catch a break, a moment of genuine ease. Is that too much to ask?

Until next time,

Dear Journal,

Okay, so… the project. It's actually happening. I’m actually *doing* it. And… I'm happy. Genuinely happy. It feels almost… foreign.

For so long, it was just this looming mountain, another weight on the already overloaded cart I seem to be perpetually hauling. But today, the summit feels within reach. And more than that, the journey itself, at least for today, has been… enjoyable.

It’s funny, isn’t it? How something that felt so draining, so impossibly large, can suddenly shift and become… fulfilling. Maybe it’s just the momentum. Maybe it’s that I'm seeing tangible progress. Whatever it is, I’m going to soak it in.

I'm not going to overthink it. I'm not going to question if I *deserve* to feel this little spark of joy. I’m just going to acknowledge it, appreciate it, and let it fuel me forward. Maybe, just maybe, this feeling – this genuine, unadulterated happiness in accomplishment – is something I can learn to cultivate. Maybe it's not just a fleeting visitor, but a potential resident.

Just… happy I'm getting my project done. And that's enough. For today, that's more than enough.

Until next time,
—Me

Dear Journal,

The question claws at me again tonight: If I'm not the best, then what's the point? It feels so… dramatic, even to write it down. Like a teenager scribbling in a diary. But the truth is, the feeling is real. This gnawing, persistent need to excel, to *dominate* in whatever arena I choose.

Maybe it's the afterglow of the project completion. Maybe that brief, beautiful high of genuine accomplishment is fading, leaving this hollow ache in its place. Because let's be honest, that high was directly tied to feeling like I was *good*. Damn good.

But now, the reality of the world rushes back in. There's always someone better. Someone faster, smarter, more experienced. And the thought of just being… average… it's suffocating. It feels like a betrayal of some inner promise, a failure to live up to a potential I may have only imagined.

I know, logically, that life isn't about being the best. It's about connection, about growth, about experiencing the small joys. But tonight, logic feels like a flimsy shield against this brutal, self-inflicted pressure.

Is this what striving really is? This constant, agonizing comparison? This unrelenting self-criticism? God, I hope not. Because if it is, I don't know how much longer I can keep running this race. I need to find a different finish line, one that doesn't involve crushing everyone else to get there. One that allows me to breathe, even if I'm just… good enough.

Until next time,
—Me

Dear Journal,

Okay, breathing human being here. That's... actually a pretty good starting point. I read back over those summaries, and it's like looking at someone else, someone trapped in a cycle of striving and self-flagellation. It’s exhausting just *reading* about it.

But "breathing human being"… that simplifies things. It acknowledges the basic truth: I'm here. I'm alive. And that, in itself, is enough for today. Maybe enough for a lot of days.

The thought that I'll be okay in the end... it's a fragile little seed of hope, isn't it? Not a booming declaration of invincibility, but a quiet, persistent belief. I need to nurture that seed.

I think the key is to stop trying to *earn* my okayness. To stop seeing it as a reward for achieving some arbitrary level of success. Maybe okayness is the default. Maybe it's the ground state. And all the striving and self-doubt are just layers of static obscuring it.

So, what can I do today to clear away some of that static? Not a grand gesture, just something small. Maybe it's as simple as drinking a cup of tea without checking my email. Maybe it's taking a walk and truly noticing the leaves changing color. Maybe it's just allowing myself to feel a feeling, even an uncomfortable one, without judging it or trying to fix it.

Because a breathing human being deserves that, right? Deserves a little peace, a little quiet, a little acceptance. And if I can give myself that, even for a few minutes, then maybe that fragile seed of hope will get a little more sunlight.

Until next time,
—Me

Dear Journal,

Okay, deep breath. Two concrete things: Life note open. Job applications. Momentum. It sounds so… clinical when I write it like that. Like a task list for a robot. But underneath the tasks, there’s a flicker of something real. A desire to *do*. To *move forward*.

The truth is, I don’t feel particularly motivated. I feel tired. Bone-deep, soul-weary tired. But I also know that wallowing in that tiredness won’t actually make it go away. It’ll just amplify it. So, Life Note open. Small victories.

Maybe it’s not about achieving some grand, external goal today. Maybe it’s about proving to myself that I can still take small steps, even when the weight of everything feels overwhelming. One application. One bullet point updated. One tiny, almost imperceptible movement towards… what? I don’t even know what "what" is anymore. But movement is movement.

And the Life Note… that feels more personal. Less about external validation and more about… me. Remembering the things that actually bring me joy, the things that make me feel alive, even in the quiet moments. Maybe refreshing that isn't about adding more achievements, but about reminding myself of the person I am *outside* of them.

So, yeah. Momentum. But maybe not momentum towards some arbitrary finish line. Momentum towards… myself. Towards a life that feels meaningful, not just impressive. That's the real goal, isn't it? Okay. One step at a time.

Until next time,
—Me

Dear Journal,

Okay, so the hackathon is… mostly done. Emphasis on the *mostly*. I'm definitely feeling the exhaustion creeping in, that heavy-eyed, slightly fuzzy feeling that comes after pushing hard for a deadline. It’s a good kind of tired, though. A productive tired.

But… it’s also interesting. Usually, this is where the post-achievement anxiety would kick in. The immediate aftermath of finishing something big used to be a breeding ground for self-criticism: *Was it good enough? Did I do everything I could? Will people actually like it?* The familiar spiral of performance-based worthiness.

Today… it’s quieter. I’m aware of the little hum of doubt, it’s there, a faint background noise. But it doesn’t have the same power. It’s almost like I can acknowledge its presence, say, "Hey doubt, I see you," and then gently nudge it aside.

Maybe it's because I'm learning to appreciate the process more than the outcome. I actually enjoyed the problem-solving, the collaboration, even the late-night coding fueled by questionable coffee. It wasn't about winning, or even about creating the "perfect" product. It was about engaging with something challenging and seeing it through.

And then there's the "A2A shenanigans" (still makes me smile). A small, almost insignificant thing, but it’s a reminder that life isn’t just about grand achievements. It’s about the little joys, the silly moments, the shared laughter with friends. These are the things that truly fill the well.

Tonight, I think I'll skip the deep dive into project feedback. Instead, I'll order some takeout, put on a mindless show, and just… be. Be tired. Be content. Be present. The hackathon will be there tomorrow, and I can address any issues then. Right now, it's enough to simply acknowledge the work that was done, and appreciate the quiet satisfaction of a day well spent. And maybe, just maybe, that’s a better measure of success than any award or recognition.

Until next time,
—Me

Dear Journal,

Okay, today feels… good. Really good, actually. A little tired, yes, the kind that settles deep in your bones after pushing hard on something. But it's a *good* tired, a satisfying weariness. I mostly finished the hackathon project, and even though I'm not entirely sure what's going on with these A2A issues, all the tasks are ticked off the list. *All* of them.

It's interesting, isn't it? In the past, this moment – the completion, the feeling of accomplishment – would have been immediately followed by a frantic search for the *next* thing. What's the next mountain to climb? What's the next validation I need? But today, that urge is… quieter.

I'm sitting here, letting the quiet settle. Letting the satisfaction of a job well done simply *be*. There's a small, almost imperceptible voice whispering, "Okay, but what about the *impact*? What about the *recognition*?" But I'm choosing to ignore it, at least for now.

Instead, I'm going to focus on this feeling of… lightness. Of relief. Of having given it my all, and that being enough. Maybe that's the shift I've been working towards finally taking hold. Maybe it's just the exhaustion talking. Either way, I'm going to savor it.

Perhaps tomorrow I'll strategize and plan the next steps. But tonight, I'm just going to breathe. And maybe watch a really bad movie. Because sometimes, all tasks completed means exactly that: all tasks completed. Including the task of letting go.

Until next time,
—Me

Dear Journal,

Okay, so the hackathon project is… mostly done. Let’s be honest, that "mostly" is doing some heavy lifting. But hey, *all tasks completed* is what I keep repeating to myself, like a mantra. And maybe it’s working. There’s definitely a satisfaction humming beneath the exhaustion.

It’s funny, this feeling is different than the past. Usually, finishing something big like this would immediately trigger the "what's next?" spiral. The pressure to maintain a certain level of output, to keep climbing, would crash in. But not today. Maybe it’s because I’ve been actively trying to embrace this idea of… okayness. Just *being* okay.

This project wasn’t perfect. I saw some questionable A2A stuff going on, and honestly, I probably could have pushed myself harder in certain areas. But I didn't. I prioritized sleep, I took breaks, and I focused on learning, not just winning. And you know what? It feels… good.

"Keep up the momentum! Stay focused!" the internal taskmaster is still shouting. But I think I can reframe that. It’s not about relentless productivity. It’s about maintaining this feeling. This feeling of… contentment. This feeling of being enough, even when things aren’t perfect.

So, the new task isn’t just “keep up the momentum.” It’s “keep up the *mindfulness*.” Keep noticing the small victories, the moments of genuine enjoyment, the feeling of being simply… okay. Maybe that’s the real hack, not just for hackathons, but for life.

Until next time,
—Me
